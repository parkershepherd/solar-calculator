# solar-calculator

Calculates if/when a solar system pays itself off, accounting for things like:

* How much you could have made by investing your money instead
* If you would have bought a generator anyway (part of the value of a solar system is less dependence on the grid)
* Change in house value
* Changes in electricity rates over time

Usage: `node cost.js`
